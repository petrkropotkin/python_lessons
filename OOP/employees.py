""" OOP and Inheritance: “Is-a” Relationships
The most general class, Employee, provides common
behavior such as bumping up salaries (giveRaise) and printing (__repr__).
There are two kinds of employees, and so two subclasses of Employee—Chef and Server.
Both override the inherited work method to print more specific messages.
Finally, our pizza robot is modeled by an even more specific class—PizzaRobot is a kind of Chef,
which is a kind of Employee. In OOP terms, we call these relationships “is-a” links:
a robot is a chef, which is an employee. """
