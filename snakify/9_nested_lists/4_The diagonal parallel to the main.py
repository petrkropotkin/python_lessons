# Given an integer n, produce a two-dimensional array of size (n×n)
#  and complete it according to the following rules, and print with a single space between characters:
# On the main diagonal write 0 .
# On the diagonals adjacent to the main, write 1 .
# On the next adjacent diagonals write 2 and so forth.
# Print the elements of the resulting array.
