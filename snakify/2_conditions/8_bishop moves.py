# In chess, the bishop moves diagonally, any number of squares. Given two different
# squares of the chessboard, determine whether a bishop can go from the first to the second in one move.

# The program receives as input four numbers from 1 to 8, specifying the column and row numbers
# of the starting square and the column and row numbers of the ending square. The program should
# output YES if a Bishop can go from the first square to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.
